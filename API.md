# LazYdrobe API Documentation

## API Overview

The **LazYdrobe API** is a RESTful interface designed to interact with the LazYdrobe wardrobe management system. It enables users and developers to perform essential CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on clothing items within the application. By leveraging this API, users can manage their wardrobe effectively allowing the application to generate personalized outfit suggestions based on weather conditions, current fashion trends, and user preferences.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up **LazYdrobe**, ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- **MySQL** or a MySQL-compatible database management system (DBMS), such as MariaDB.
- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher).
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository).
- **A MySQL Query Editor** (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or DBeaver).
- **Pip** (to manage Python package installations).

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the LazYdrobe project locally:


### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository where the SQL script is stored. This will allow you to access the SQL file required to set up the database.
git clone https://github.com/abd-abdur/LazYdrobe.git

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory containing the project.
cd path/to/LazYdrobe

### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment
For Python-based projects, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
```python -m venv .venv```

Activate the virtual environment:
On Windows: 
```.\.venv\Scripts\activate```
On macOS/Linux: source 
```.venv/bin/activate```

### Step 4: Install Required Dependencies
Install the required packages from the requirements.txt file.
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Step 5: Configure Database Connection
Ensure that the database credentials in main.py (or a separate configuration file) match your local database setup.


## Running the API Application


To run the FastAPI application, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your `main.py` file is located.
3. Use the following command to start the application:

   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. Once the server is running, you can access the application locally at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

## Using Postman to Interact with the API
