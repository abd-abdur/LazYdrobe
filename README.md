### Why We Chose SQL for LazYdrobe

1. **Structured Data and Relationships**  
   LazYdrobe handles well-defined entities like Users, Wardrobe Items, Outfits, and Weather Data, all with clear relationships. SQL's use of primary and foreign keys helps enforce these connections efficiently ensuring data integrity.

2. **Data Integrity and Consistency**  
   SQL provides ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) to maintain strong data integrity. This ensures that operations like adding wardrobe items or generating outfit suggestions are reliable and consistent.

3. **Complex Queries**  
   Generating outfit suggestions requires complex joins between multiple tables (e.g., Users, WardrobeItems, WeatherData). SQL excels at handling such joins and aggregations making it ideal for our application's data retrieval needs.

4. **Scalability**  
   Modern SQL databases support scalability through partitioning and indexing making them capable of handling larger datasets as the app grows.

5. **Data Consistency Over Flexibility**  
   LazYdrobe benefits from the structured schema enforcement SQL provides. While NoSQL offers flexibility, SQL's consistency ensures that wardrobe items, trends, and weather data are always valid and related correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before you set up **LazYdrobe** ensure that you have the following tools installed:

- **MySQL** or a MySQL-compatible database management system (DBMS), such as MariaDB.
- **Python** (version 3.7 or higher).
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository).
- **A MySQL Query Editor** (e.g., MySQL Workbench, phpMyAdmin, or DBeaver).
- **Pip** (to manage Python package installations).

## Database Setup and Usage Instructions

### Features of the SQL Script:
Database Creation: Automatically creates the required tables with appropriate fields and relationships, if they don't already exist.
Sample Data Insertion: Inserts initial data to simulate a real-world environment, making it easy for developers to test and interact with the system.
Relationship Management: Defines foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity across multiple related tables.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository where the SQL script is stored. This will allow you to access the SQL file required to set up the database.
git clone https://github.com/abd-abdur/LazYdrobe.git

### Step 2: Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate to the directory containing the project.
cd path/to/LazYdrobe

### Step 3: (Optional) Set Up a Virtual Environment
For Python-based projects, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies.
python -m venv .venv

Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate

### Step 4: Install Required Dependencies (Optional)
Install the required packages from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Step 5: Launch Your Database Management System (DBMS)
You need to use a SQL-compatible DBMS like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, or similar. Open your DBMS and navigate to the query editor.

Popular choices:

pgAdmin (PostgreSQL): For PostgreSQL databases (what we have chosen!)
MySQL Workbench: For MySQL databases.
phpMyAdmin: A web-based tool for managing MySQL databases.

### Step 6: Run the SQL Script to Set Up the Database
In your DBMS query editor:

Locate the provided SQL script named database_setup.sql inside the repository: path/to/LazYdrobe/database_setup.sql.
Copy the entire SQL script content from the database_setup.sql file.
Paste the copied script into your DBMS query editor.
Execute the script (usually by pressing F5, Ctrl+Enter, or clicking the Execute button).
This will create the required tables (such as Users, Wardrobe_Items, Outfits, etc.), set up relationships between them, and insert sample data for testing.

## Database Structure and Key Components

### 1. Users Table
Purpose: Stores basic information about each user.
Key Fields: user_id, username, email, password_hash, location, preferences, date_joined.
Primary Key: user_id (auto-incremented for uniqueness).
Unique Constraints: email must be unique.
### 2. Wardrobe_Items Table
Purpose: Stores information about wardrobe items owned by users.
Key Fields: item_id, user_id, type, season, fabric, color, size, tags, image_url, date_added.
Foreign Key: user_id references Users(user_id), ensuring each wardrobe item belongs to a valid user.
Relationships: If a user is deleted, their wardrobe items are also deleted (ON DELETE CASCADE).
### 3. Outfits Table
Purpose: Stores outfits that are suggested or created for different occasions.
Key Fields: outfit_id, user_id, occasion, weather_condition, trend_score, date_suggested.
Foreign Key: user_id references Users(user_id).
### 4. Outfit_Wardrobe_Items Table
Purpose: A junction table that links outfits to specific wardrobe items (many-to-many relationships).
Key Fields: outfit_id, item_id (composite primary key).
Foreign Keys: Links outfit_id to Outfits(outfit_id) and item_id to Wardrobe_Items(item_id).
### 5. Weather_Data Table
Purpose: Stores weather conditions relevant to a user's location.
Key Fields: weather_id, user_id, location, temperature, precipitation, wind_speed, humidity, date_fetched.
Foreign Key: user_id references Users(user_id).
### 6. Fashion_Trends Table
Purpose: Stores information about fashion trends, including categories and source URLs.
Key Fields: trend_id, title, description, categories, image_url, date_fetched, source_url.
### 7. E_Commerce_Products Table
Purpose: Stores product suggestions related to wardrobe items, linked to e-commerce platforms.
Key Fields: product_id, user_id, suggested_item_type, product_name, price, product_url, image_url, date_suggested.
Foreign Key: user_id references Users(user_id).

## Testing the Database
Once the tables are set up and sample data is inserted, you can begin testing the database.

1. Run Queries: You can run SELECT statements on each table to view the data, ensuring everything has been created correctly.
SELECT * FROM Users;
SELECT * FROM Wardrobe_Items;
SELECT * FROM Outfits;
2. Modify Sample Data: You can modify, delete, or add new entries to test different aspects of the database, such as the relationships between users and their wardrobe items.
3. Check Data Integrity: Try deleting a user and see how it cascades down to related records in other tables (e.g., their wardrobe items should be deleted).
