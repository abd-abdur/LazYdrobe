## Key Components
Here are the main components and their purposes:

Navbar (Navbar.js): Displays the navigation links for the app.
Footer (Footer.js): Shows copyright information.
Wardrobe (Wardrobe.js): Displays wardrobe items with filtering functionality.
WardrobeItem (WardrobeItem.js): Represents individual wardrobe items.
WardrobeModal (WardrobeModal.js): Modal for adding/editing wardrobe items.
OutfitSuggestions (OutfitSuggestions.js): Displays outfit recommendations based on weather.

## Additional Notes
Styling: Each component has its own .css file in the src/components folder, keeping styles modular and specific to each component.
Routing: The app uses react-router-dom for client-side routing. Routes are defined in App.js, which manages navigation between different parts of the application.
Modal Library: react-modal is used to create the add/edit modal for wardrobe items. If it’s not installed automatically, run npm install react-modal.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

npm start: Runs the app in development mode.
npm run build: Builds the app for production to the build folder.
npm test: Launches the test runner.

## Troubleshooting
Dependency Issues: If you encounter issues during npm install, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed.
Development Server: If the app doesn’t load in the browser, confirm that the development server is running on http://localhost:3000 and that no other app is using this port.
